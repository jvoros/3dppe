      <description>The masks use HEPA filter material. HEPA filter material removes 99.97% (ASME, U.S. DOE) of particles whose diameter is equal to 0.3 Î¼m which makes it similar to P100 filters, which exceed the 95% filtration of an N95 mask recommended by the CDC and WHO for protection from airborne transmission of COVID-19.
The filter material in these photos was taken from a vacuum filter readily available at a local home improvement store.</description>
