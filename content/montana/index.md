The first mask design a slight modification of plans by [Spencer Zaugg](https://longliveyoursmile.com/3d-printable-mask-for-covid-19/) a dentist in Montana, who generously shared his designs.

By stretching the original design *10% in the z-axis*, and printing at *100%, 90% and 83%* we have found the masks fit a wide variety of faces comfortably with a tight seal.
